1. What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?

Some accessibility challenges I faced were learning about all the ARIA label roles and attributes and where best to apply them.

2. How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?

I ensured my design was responsive and accessible by using flexbox and grid to sure navigation in my website is a smooth and easily accessible experience for all users. I also took advantage of accessibility features like ARIA roles.


3. What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?

Some tools that I found helpful were WEBAIM to make sure my color contrast was sufficient and met WCAG Standards. I also used the website css-tricks.com to make sure I was using the correct Flexbox Layout and to make my web page easily accessible.
